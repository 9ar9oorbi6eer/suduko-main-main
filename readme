project name: Sudoku Validator
description: this program has been created using multithreads in order to validate a given sudoku file called solution.txt, the main objective was to create 4 threads, each thread was given a certain task to complete. threads 1-3 were responsible of validating 3 rows and 3 sub-grids and thread 4 was responsible of validating all the rows of the sudoku. A parent thread located in the main file (mssv.c) is responsible of making it all work together.

table of contents:
C files:
mssv.c: is my main file and includes my main function that makes everything work

threads.c: includes all the threads that are required to validate the sudoku in addition to some validating messages

variables.c: includes variable declerations and FILE I/O

mssv_utils.c: includes all the functions that simplified the main file and made the code more readable

Header files .h
threads.h

variables.h

mssv_utils.h

Makefile


Head to the Cli:
Usage: clear all object files (make clear)
compile the code: make
enter the following input: ./mssv solution.txt 1 (the number at the end is the delay, you can choose any number you want) it is prefered to choose a higher number which equals a higher delay, the reason behind that is that it will help identify any synchronisation issues

you should be presented with an output like this:
Delay set to: 1 seconds
Thread ID-140455188612672-4 is the last thread.
Thread 1: Thread ID-140455213790784-1: valid
Thread 2: Thread ID-140455205398080-2: valid
Thread 3: Thread ID-140455197005376-3: valid
Thread 4: Thread ID-140455188612672-4: valid
There are 27 valid rows, columns, and subgrids, therefore the solution is valid.

you can also try to check an invalid sudoku, by including the invalid.txt file and you should be presented with an output as follows: ps: feel free to change invalid.txt to your desire in order to check the validator with as many invalid sudoku's as you wish

Delay set to: 4 seconds

Thread 4: Thread ID-140029057812032-4: column 9 is invalid
There are 24 valid rows, columns, and subgrids, therefore the solution is invalid.
